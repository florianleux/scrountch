## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### For New Projects (Using Universal Standards)

1. **Start with Architecture**: Read `/agnostic/architecture_patterns.mdc` to understand the recommended layered architecture
2. **Set Up Standards**: Implement patterns from `/agnostic/flutter_standards.mdc` for consistent code organization
3. **Build UI Components**: Use templates from `/agnostic/widget_guidelines.mdc` for consistent UI patterns
4. **Optimize Performance**: Apply techniques from `/agnostic/performance_rules.mdc` for optimal app performance

### For This Project (Scrountch Implementation)

1. **Follow Universal Standards**: Apply all patterns from `/agnostic/` folder
2. **Project Configuration**: Use `/specific/build-rules.mdc` for build processes and project setup
3. **Design System**: Follow `/specific/design-rules.mdc` for UI styling and branding
4. **Customize as Needed**: Adapt universal patterns to project-specific requirements

- **Reusable Components**: Navigation, loading, and error display templates
- **Service Layer Patterns**: API service and navigation service templates
- **Testing Standards**: Widget and service testing templates with examples

**When to Use**: Establishing coding standards for any Flutter development team

### [`performance_rules.mdc`](agnostic/performance_rules.mdc)

**Universal Flutter/Dart performance optimization patterns**

- **Widget Performance**: ValueListenableBuilder patterns and const constructor optimization
- **Memory Management**: Resource disposal patterns and async operation safety
- **List Performance**: ListView optimization and key usage for large datasets
- **Image & Asset Optimization**: Efficient image loading and asset preloading strategies
- **Build Method Optimization**: Separating static and dynamic content for minimal rebuilds
- **Theme Performance**: Efficient theme access patterns
- **State Management Performance**: Efficient setState usage and state splitting strategies
- **Performance Monitoring**: Profiling tools and automated performance testing

**When to Use**: Optimizing performance in any Flutter application

### [`widget_guidelines.mdc`](agnostic/widget_guidelines.mdc)

**Universal Flutter widget patterns and UI component standards**

- **Widget Hierarchy**: Screen structure templates and composition rules
- **Reusable Patterns**: Header, loading, error display, and empty state components
- **Input Widget Patterns**: Form fields, dropdowns, and input validation templates
- **List & Card Patterns**: Consistent list items and card layouts
- **Dialog & Modal Patterns**: Alert dialogs, confirmation dialogs, and bottom sheets
- **Responsive Design**: Breakpoint systems and adaptive layouts
- **Performance Optimization**: Const widget usage and ValueListenableBuilder patterns

**When to Use**: Creating consistent UI components for any Flutter application

## üèóÔ∏è Project-Specific Implementation (`/specific/`)

### [`build-rules.mdc`](specific/build-rules.mdc)

**Scrountch project build processes and development workflows**

- **Build Scripts**: Required build commands and NDK configuration
- **Development Process**: Git workflow, commit standards, and testing requirements
- **Project Structure**: Specific folder organization and file locations
- **Troubleshooting**: Common build issues and resolution steps
- **Performance Metrics**: Expected build times and APK sizes
- **Maintenance**: Dependency updates and cleanup procedures

**When to Use**: Setting up development environment for Scrountch project

### [`design-rules.mdc`](specific/design-rules.mdc)

**Scrountch application design system and UI standards**

- **Design Philosophy**: "Jaune Bold" visual direction and brand guidelines
- **Color Palette**: Project-specific color schemes and usage rules
- **Typography**: Custom font usage (Dela Gothic One, Chivo) and text styles
- **Button System**: Three-variant button system with specific styling
- **Screen Structure**: Standardized layout patterns and spacing rules
- **Form Components**: Custom input fields and UI element specifications

**When to Use**: Implementing UI components for Scrountch application

## üîÑ Integration Strategy

### How Universal and Specific Work Together

1. **Foundation**: Universal standards provide the architectural foundation and coding practices
2. **Customization**: Project-specific rules customize the visual design and build processes
3. **Consistency**: Universal patterns ensure maintainable, scalable code structure
4. **Branding**: Specific rules ensure consistent visual identity and user experience

### Migration Path for Existing Projects

1. **Assess Current Architecture**: Compare existing code against universal patterns
2. **Identify Gaps**: Determine which universal patterns to adopt
3. **Create Project-Specific Rules**: Document your customizations in `/specific/` folder
4. **Gradual Migration**: Refactor code incrementally using universal templates
5. **Team Training**: Ensure all developers understand both universal and specific standards
