# Scrountch Project Implementation Guide

**Project-specific configurations, design system, and implementation details**

This collection contains customizations and configurations specific to the Scrountch family inventory application. These documents build upon the universal Flutter standards found in `/agnostic/` and provide project-specific implementation guidance.

## üìã Project Overview

**Scrountch** is a family inventory management application that helps families track and organize their belongings across different rooms and storage locations.

### Key Features

- **Item Management**: Add, edit, and delete family inventory items
- **Location Tracking**: Organize items by room, shelf, and storage location
- **Search & Filter**: Find items quickly with advanced search capabilities
- **CSV Import/Export**: Bulk import existing inventory data
- **Family Sharing**: Multi-user access for family members

| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------- | -------- |
| [`design-rules.mdc`](design-rules.mdc) | UI design system and visual standards     | French/English | **High** |
| [`build-rules.mdc`](build-rules.mdc)   | Build processes and development workflows | French         | **High** |

## üé® Design System ([`design-rules.mdc`](design-rules.mdc))

### Visual Philosophy: "Jaune Bold"

The Scrountch app follows a distinctive **"Jaune Bold"** design philosophy characterized by:

- **Dominant Yellow Color Scheme**: Consistent `#FFE333` background across all screens
- **Bold Typography**: Ultra-heavy fonts for maximum impact
- **Minimalist Interface**: Clean layouts without visual clutter
- **Strong Contrast**: Black elements on yellow backgrounds for accessibility

### Key Design Elements

- **Primary Color**: `#FFE333` (Yellow) - Used for all screen backgrounds
- **Typography**:
  - **Titles & Buttons**: Dela Gothic One (bold, impactful)
  - **Body Text**: Chivo Regular (readable, elegant)
- **Button System**: Three standardized button variants (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary)
- **Layout**: Consistent 24px padding and standardized spacing throughout

### Implementation Requirements

- All screens must use the unified yellow background color
- Custom button widgets must be used instead of default Flutter buttons
- Font usage is strictly limited to the two specified families
- Screen headers must follow the standardized navigation pattern

## üîß Build System ([`build-rules.mdc`](build-rules.mdc))

### Critical Build Requirements

- **MANDATORY**: Use only the provided build scripts (`./build_apk_simple.sh` or `./build_apk.sh`)
- **FORBIDDEN**: Never use `flutter build apk --release` directly
- **NDK Configuration**: Scripts automatically configure Android NDK version 26.1.10909125

### Development Workflow

1. **Pre-commit**: Ensure all lints are resolved and tests pass
2. **Commit Standards**: Use standardized commit message format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `style:`, etc.)
3. **Build Process**: Always use provided build scripts for consistency
4. **Verification**: Check APK output and expected file sizes

### Project-Specific Configurations

- **Firebase Integration**: Cloud Firestore for data storage
- **Target Platform**: Android APK for family device installation
- **Build Size**: Expected ~50MB APK with tree-shaking optimization
- **Development Environment**: Specific NDK and SDK requirements

## üîÑ Integration with Universal Standards

### How Project-Specific Rules Extend Universal Patterns

#### Architecture Integration

- **Universal Foundation**: Layered architecture from `/agnostic/architecture_patterns.mdc`
- **Project Customization**: Firebase service integration and family-specific business logic
- **Service Layer**: Extends universal service patterns with inventory-specific operations

#### UI Component Integration

- **Universal Patterns**: Base widget patterns from `/agnostic/widget_guidelines.mdc`
- **Project Customization**: Yellow-themed components with custom typography
- **Design System**: Project-specific button system and color scheme overrides

#### Performance Integration

- **Universal Optimizations**: All performance rules from `/agnostic/performance_rules.mdc`
- **Project Specifics**: Image optimization for inventory photos and CSV processing performance

## üöÄ Getting Started for New Contributors

### Prerequisites

1. **Universal Standards Knowledge**: Read all documents in `/agnostic/` folder first
